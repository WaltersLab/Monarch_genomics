# Here we provide the scripts to calculate the nucleotide diversity of  Eastern and Western monarchs for different genomic positions. 

Genomic positions were classified as Intergenic, Intronic, 1st, 2nd, 3rd codon positions and 4-fold degenerate sites (4D).

# Monarch_Pi_all_sites.py
The script Monarch_Pi_all_sites.py generates the data base of nucleotide diversity seperatly for Intergenic, Intronic, 1st, 2nd, 3rd codon positions and 4-fold degenerate sites (4D). These results are provided in Pi_data.csv
