The scripts used for mapping the population resequencing data to the reference genome and the SNP calling can be found in the directory “SNP_calling”

The final set of genotypes used in this study can be found in here:

The file dadi_temp.py has the script to run demographic history using dadi. 

Monarch_east_west_plots.py script give the genome scan plots
