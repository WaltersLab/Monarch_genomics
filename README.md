This is a Repository for the data used for various monarch genomic papers: 
# [Genomic evidence for gene flow between monarchs with divergent migratory phenotypes and flight performance ](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15508)

# [ For 1977 samples analysis click here ](https://github.com/venta380/Monarch_genomics/tree/master/Museumomics/1977_samples_analysis)

The scripts used for mapping the population resequencing data to the reference genome and the SNP calling can be found in the directory “SNP_calling”


The reference genome assembly used in this project is a version 3 scaffolds from Monarchbase:
